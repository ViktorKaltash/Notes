Notes is a program that stores notes from registered users in
MySQL database. The project is still under development and will be updated.

## Libraries used
This program used IDE Intellij IDEA, SceneBuilder, libraries such as
JavaFX, MySQL-Connector/J, h2 database java, as well as assembly via Maven.

Required libraries to use:

* JavaFX - https://openjfx.io
* MySQL-Connector/J - https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/j/
* H2 database java - https://h2database.github.io/html/main.html

## Installing a database in MySQL

First of all, you need to connect the MySQL database. To do this, in the project folder
"src/main/resources/MySQL" contains files for initialization. It is necessary to run the file "Init DB.sql"
in MySQL.

## Using the program

In order to use Notes, you need to register a user; for this we register him in our database. Enter the userâ€™s email and password on the initial screen and press the Register button;

Then we fill in nickname to the database

After these steps, our account is registered in the database

As you can see, our note has been added to our workspace and is now stored in the database. If we decide to re-login to the program on the same account, our note will be uploaded to us.
